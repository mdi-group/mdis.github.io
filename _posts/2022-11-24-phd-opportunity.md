## Description
This project will address a fundamental problem in applying deep learning to many materials science problems â€“ how to develop generalizable models from scarce, expensive to obtain datasets. Deep learning (DL) methods have started to show great potential for accelerating the materials discovery process, by suggesting new materials, accelerating experiments and distilling knowledge from literature. To date, the majority of DL applications to materials design have concentrated on a few properties of perfect, bulk materials systems.
This is because there are large, high-quality datasets available, but there are few such resources for many other important properties, such as dielectric functions or electron energies. The reason is that such properties are challenging and expensive to characterise, either experimentally or using physics-based models. The PhD will address this problem using Bayesian statistics to generate databases that are maximally expressive and diverse, even when there are few examples. The student will develop graph neural networks (GNNs) with built-in uncertainty quantification (UQ). The UQ-GNN combination will allow active learning where training data is selected to maximally reduce model uncertainty. These methods will be applied, with transfer learning to develop predictive models for the dielectric function and electron energies (ionisation potentials and electron affinities) of functional materials.

For this project and experience in either science or computer science will be helpful. A first degree in chemistry, physics, engineering or equivalent is required. If you have a good background in a scientific/engineering discipling but no previous computing experience you will be trained as part of the project, if you have a background in computing but no previous chemistry/materials science experience you will also be trained.
