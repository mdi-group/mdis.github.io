## Description

This project brings together the expertise of Dr. Keith Butler in machine learning and materials simulations, with experimental input from Dr. Joe Briscoe on ferroelectric materials for photovoltaic application. Ferroelectric PVs have recently shown enormous potential as an emerging PV technology â€“ promising a low-cost, earth-abundant and scalable solution to meeting renewable energy demands in the medium term. Discovering optimal materials compositions is critical to the success of FPV and this project will combing high-performance computing, quantum mechanics simulations and machine learning to find these best-in-class materials. These will then be developed experimentally by Dr. Briscoe and his team. This project is an opportunity to contribute towards progressing green energy, while leaning and applying state-of-the-art methods from data science and computer simulations .

For this project and experience in either science or computer science will be helpful. A first degree in chemistry, physics, engineering or equivalent is required. If you have a good background in a scientific/engineering discipling but no previous computing experience you will be trained as part of the project, if you have a background in computing but no previous chemistry/materials science experience you will also be trained.
